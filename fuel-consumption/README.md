This dataset came from kaggle, you can visit with this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmettyilmazz/fuel-consumption

The sample dashboard can be seen in separated files `Dashboard-part1.png`, `Dashboard-part2.png`, `Dashboard-part3.png`
You can use freely the excel file that have made the dashboard

The explanation of the dashboard:
- we can explain the highest to the lowest fuel consumption and emissions for this type of car from the dataset we have
- we can describe global emission trendlines over the years
- we can choose a year to see the highest to lowest fuel consumption and emissions for the type of car
- we can choose the composition of vehicle class, transmissions, fuel types based on manufacture and year
- we can see the distribution of emissions, fuel consumption, fuel types based on manufacture and year
- we can see the relationship between the parameters fuel consumption vs engine size, emissions vs engine size based on manufacture and year
